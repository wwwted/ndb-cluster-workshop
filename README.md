===================
![icon](https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/mysqlhighavailability/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/MySQL_Cluster-300x125.png)

In this workshop, you will learn about MySQL Cluster. This workshop is a blend of presentation and hands-on work.
The presentations can be found in [docs](./docs) folder and hands on work in [labs](./labs) folder. There are some small scripts that are usefull for looking at data in ndbinfo in the [tools](./tools) folder.
Feel free to bookmark (star) this page for future testing.

To fully benefit (not mandatory) from hands-on work in this workshop its important that you have some prior experience with databases and are comfortable working in a Linux/Unix environment.

If you want to attend the hands-on work you need to download MCM (Mysql Cluster Manager) as described [here](/labs/prework.md).  
MySQL Cluster Manager [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/wwwted/fb151c3a14c3e9ba65fe0f09ed65a1c4), complete list of commands is available in our online [reference manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-cluster-manager/1.4/en/mcm-client-commands.html).
